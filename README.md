# c-sharp-katas
Some classic katas build with NUnit; an adaptation of [Ala Barber's Code Katas](https://github.com/AlanBarber/CodeKatas) repo.

Build using NUnit test projects.

Feel free to contribute your own, but stick with .NET Core and Nunit for cross-platform goodness

Just clone and use your favorite .NET compiler / IDE and go to town :D
